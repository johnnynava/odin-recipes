Simple HTML website made for the first assignment of the Odin Project.

A lot of what I learn was put into practice with this first assignment, maybe I should have used the em and strong html elements as well.

I think the headings on the body of the recipe pages themselves could use with less hierarchization (just going up to h2 or h3 maybe)

The main page could also use with some more personalization and flavor but I was laser focused on doing what was asked from me.
